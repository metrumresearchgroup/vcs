The premise of the vcs package is to give a single interface with a number of version control systems for an R user. The user can maintain and interact with repositories on svn and git systems on their local and remote systems. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
d3Tree::d3tree(data = list(root = d3Tree::df2tree(rootname = 'vcs',struct = df),layout = 'collapse'))
```

The functionalities can be split into two major groups:

  - Passive inquiry where the user does not need a local checkout and can inspect the remote repository from within R.
  - Active maintenance where the user can define a specific checkout and then manage it. 
  
Two types of users were taken into account when writing the package, users that are comfortable with command line (CLI) calls and new R users that need a graphical user interface (GUI) to help them run the functions. The GUI that the package uses depends heavily on another R package that was written to compliment it, [jsTree](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/jsTree).

```{r,echo=FALSE}
d3Tree::d3tree(data = list(root = d3Tree::df2tree(rootname = 'vcs',struct = df2),layout = 'collapse'))
```

## Functions

### Passive Inquiry

#### CLI
  - **grepr**: run recursive grep directly on local paths and remote branches
  - **list_repos**: list repositories of a user in a version control repository
  - **ls_remote**: list files on remote branches on a version control repository
  - **diff_head**: query the difference in files between current fetch and the HEAD of a repository
  - **setwd_remote**: replace inline script from local path to remote path
  - **source_remote**: source script on remote branches, works for reading in data on remote and nested sourcing
  
#### GUI
  - **navigate_remote**
    - visualize the structure of a remote branch prior to cloning/forking

```{r,results='asis'}

#local

vcs::navigate_remote(path = '~/projects/vcs',vcs = 'git')


#remote

vcs::navigate_remote(path = 'metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve',vcs = 'github')

vcs::navigate_remote(path = 'metrumrg/qapply',vcs = 'bitbucket')

```

  - **Interactive grepr**
    - Run recursive grep directly on remote branches of Github/Bitbucket/SVN and inspect the results using an interactive UI.
    - Preview text files in the branch without needing to checkout (Github/BitBucket only)
    - The search term inputed will be used in the preview in a search textbox to highlight the term in document. The user can then continue and use the search box to search for other terms int he text.

### Active maintenance

#### CLI
  - **sparse_checkout**: create a sparse checkout of a repository on github/bitbucket/svn
  - **update_depth**: if the git repository was checked out with a depth setting, use this function to update or cancel the depth setting
  
#### GUI
 - **sasha**: Alexa for R!

Control your version control repositories both on your checkouts and on the master. Just point Sasha to a root path where the repositories are set and the rest is done for you. 

  - Toggle between local checkouts and remote repos
  
  - Local
  
    - Auto recognition of svn and git parent folders
    - Checks to see what the current (sparse) checkout is compared to HEAD
    - Users can update the definitions of the (sparse) checkout through the GUI
    
  - Remote
    - Navigate to any online repository on Github, Bitbucket or SVN
    - View the structure of a branch in the repo
    - Preview* text files in the branch without needing to checkout (Github/BitBucket only)
    - Search within previewed file for text
    - Select files to create (sparse) checkout and check them out to local path of choice
